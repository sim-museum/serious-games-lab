# biq — Claude Code project notes

## Cardplay engine — DO NOT confuse with BEN

biq is **NN-free**. Bidding goes through `native_bidder.NativeBiddingEngine`
(rule-based, system-driven), opening leads through `native_lead`, and
follow-on cards through `get_mc_card_play` (Monte Carlo + DDS).
`BridgeEngine` only loads the DDS solver. **BEN has been REMOVED** —
ignore any older docstring or comment that mentions it.

## To-do — per-tab comparison-mode widget

Each corpus tab in `tools/qplus_mixed_corpus.py` (Random, Bidding-system
matrix, Slam-eligible) should expose a tri-state widget (radio group or
combo box) that selects what's being compared in the run:

1. **Compare bidding only** — current behaviour. The diff tool feeds
   the deal hands to both biq's bidder and Q-Plus's recorded bidding,
   reaches a contract on each side, and scores both via DDS. Tells us
   nothing about cardplay strength because DDS plays both sides
   omnisciently.

2. **Compare cardplay only** — Q-Plus's recorded bidding is used as
   the contract for BOTH sides. Q-Plus's cardplay engine plays the
   deal as recorded; biq's MC+DDS engine plays the same contract on
   the same deal. Compare actual tricks taken. This isolates cardplay
   strength.

3. **Compare end-to-end performance** — deal → biq bids → biq plays
   vs deal → Q-Plus bids → Q-Plus plays. The fullest comparison;
   conflates bidding and cardplay strength but matches what a user
   would see at the table.

### Implementation notes

* The widget belongs on each corpus tab (not in Calibration / Help).
* State 2 needs Q-Plus's bidding history extractable from the
  `savescore.qss` per-deal blocks — `parse_bdl_with_systems` in
  `tools/qplus_mixed_corpus.py` already returns this; expose the
  per-deal auction tokens so biq's cardplay engine gets the same
  auction inferences Q-Plus's declarer used.
* State 2 and 3 require Q-Plus's actual played-tricks count to be
  parsed from the QSS. Q-Plus writes this on `save match and exit`;
  the current `mixed_corpus_diff.py` ignores it in favour of
  re-running DDS on the contract. The parser would need to surface
  the trick count per deal so the comparison report can show
  Q-Plus-actual vs biq-MC+DDS.
* `tools/mixed_corpus_diff.py` would grow a `--mode {bidding,
  cardplay, end-to-end}` flag matching the widget state.
* For state 2 the report header should make it explicit that BOTH
  sides played the same contract — otherwise it's not interpretable.

### Why this matters

The current diff tool produces **bidding-only** numbers. All the
"+1.82 IMP/deal" / "+0.59 IMP/deal" results from the polish session
are pure bidding gaps. We have no measurement of whether biq's
MC+DDS cardplay is competitive with Q-Plus's commercial engine.
Until states 2 and 3 exist, end-to-end strength claims are
extrapolations.
