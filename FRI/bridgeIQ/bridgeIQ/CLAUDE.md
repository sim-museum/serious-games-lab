# biq — Claude Code project notes

## Cardplay engine — DO NOT confuse with BEN

biq is **NN-free**. Bidding goes through `native_bidder.NativeBiddingEngine`
(rule-based, system-driven), opening leads through `native_lead`, and
follow-on cards through `get_mc_card_play` (Monte Carlo + DDS).
`BridgeEngine` only loads the DDS solver. **BEN has been REMOVED** —
ignore any older docstring or comment that mentions it.

## To-do — per-tab comparison-mode widget

Each corpus tab in `tools/qplus_mixed_corpus.py` (Random, Bidding-system
matrix, Slam-eligible) should expose a tri-state widget (radio group or
combo box) that selects what's being compared in the run:

1. **Compare bidding only** — current behaviour. The diff tool feeds
   the deal hands to both biq's bidder and Q-Plus's recorded bidding,
   reaches a contract on each side, and scores both via DDS. Tells us
   nothing about cardplay strength because DDS plays both sides
   omnisciently.

2. **Compare cardplay only** — Q-Plus's recorded bidding is used as
   the contract for BOTH sides. Q-Plus's cardplay engine plays the
   deal as recorded; biq's MC+DDS engine plays the same contract on
   the same deal. Compare actual tricks taken. This isolates cardplay
   strength.

3. **Compare end-to-end performance** — deal → biq bids → biq plays
   vs deal → Q-Plus bids → Q-Plus plays. The fullest comparison;
   conflates bidding and cardplay strength but matches what a user
   would see at the table.

### Implementation notes

* The widget belongs on each corpus tab (not in Calibration / Help).
* State 2 needs Q-Plus's bidding history extractable from the
  `savescore.qss` per-deal blocks — `parse_bdl_with_systems` in
  `tools/qplus_mixed_corpus.py` already returns this; expose the
  per-deal auction tokens so biq's cardplay engine gets the same
  auction inferences Q-Plus's declarer used.
* State 2 and 3 require Q-Plus's actual played-tricks count to be
  parsed from the QSS. Q-Plus writes this on `save match and exit`;
  the current `mixed_corpus_diff.py` ignores it in favour of
  re-running DDS on the contract. The parser would need to surface
  the trick count per deal so the comparison report can show
  Q-Plus-actual vs biq-MC+DDS.
* `tools/mixed_corpus_diff.py` would grow a `--mode {bidding,
  cardplay, end-to-end}` flag matching the widget state.
* For state 2 the report header should make it explicit that BOTH
  sides played the same contract — otherwise it's not interpretable.

### Why this matters

The current diff tool produces **bidding-only** numbers. All the
"+1.82 IMP/deal" / "+0.59 IMP/deal" results from the polish session
are pure bidding gaps. We have no measurement of whether biq's
MC+DDS cardplay is competitive with Q-Plus's commercial engine.
Until states 2 and 3 exist, end-to-end strength claims are
extrapolations.

## Cardplay benchmarking — three planned harnesses

The current `tools/mixed_corpus_diff.py --mode cardplay` plays biq
on ALL four seats vs Q-Plus's recorded play, then scores by IMP.
This biq-vs-biq symmetry CANCELS declarer-side improvements:
biq's improved defender plays equally well against biq's improved
declarer, so trick-delta barely shifts. Confirmed empirically —
defender-only rules show positive gains, declarer rules don't.

To measure asymmetric improvements honestly we need harnesses
where biq plays ONE side and a different engine plays the other.

### Plan 1 — QSS replay harness (single-seat biq vs recorded Q-Plus)
**File**: `tools/mixed_corpus_diff.py` — add `--mode replay`.

For each deal × each of the 4 seats:
- Replay the deal trick-by-trick from the QSS.
- For the 3 non-biq seats, play Q-Plus's recorded card.
- For biq's seat, biq's planner/MC decides.
- Validate biq's card is legal; track wins/losses.
- Aggregate per-seat trick-delta vs Q-Plus's seat performance.

Yields 4 isolated measurements per deal:
- biq-as-N declarer/defender tricks vs Q-Plus's N tricks.
- Same for E, S, W.

Each is an HONEST measure of biq's skill at that seat. Symmetric
biq-vs-biq cancelation gone.

**Effort**: ~100 lines harness, reuses QSS parser, planner, MC.
**Status**: TO BUILD FIRST.

### Plan 2 — Multi-biq-bot self-play (4 distinct configs)
**File**: new `tools/multi_bot_diff.py`.

Run cardplay with 4 different biq configs at the 4 seats:
- biq-A = Phase 15 baseline (committed best)
- biq-B = Phase 15 + Phase 23 entries
- biq-C = Phase 15 + Phase 23 + 25 (K-loc finesse)
- biq-D = all attempted items

For this to work, the planner must accept a config object per
call (currently it's module-global). ~50 lines of refactor.

Each variant is biased to fire/suppress different phases. Across
many deals, the variant taking the most declarer tricks on its
contracts wins. Head-to-head comparison.

Useful for:
- A/B testing planner additions without biq-vs-biq symmetry.
- AlphaZero-style training later (loser's config trains toward
  winner's, if/when we add learned components).

**Effort**: ~50 lines planner refactor + ~150 lines harness.
**Status**: TO BUILD SECOND.

### Plan 3 — Q-NET TCP protocol RE (live biq vs Q-Plus over network)
Q-Plus 17.1 ships `Q-NET.EXE` (2.8 MB, beside `QBRIDGE.EXE`).
Architecture: `QBRIDGE.EXE` ←DDE→ `Q-NET.EXE` ←TCP→ remote
`Q-NET.EXE` ←DDE→ remote `QBRIDGE.EXE`. Commands recovered from
strings:
```
DDE_CMD_CONNECT / DISCONNECT / START_SERVER / STOP_SERVER
DDE_CMD_DIRECT_MESSAGE / NET_COMMAND / RESEND_MESSAGE
DDE_REQ_STATE / EXIT
```

No documentation ships for the wire protocol. Reverse-engineering
path:
1. Run two Q-Plus instances locally under Wine.
2. Configure one as bridge server, the other as client.
3. Capture TCP traffic with tcpdump/Wireshark.
4. Decode message format (probably framed binary with a header
   indicating command type).
5. biq implements a client speaking that protocol.

Enables LIVE interactive play between biq and Q-Plus — biq's bids
get factored into Q-Plus's auction; Q-Plus's cardplay adapts to
biq's plays. Useful for genuine competitive testing.

**Effort**: 2-3 days RE + ~500 lines of protocol client.
**Status**: TO BUILD THIRD.
