"""Reading PARTNER's defensive signals — the complement to backend.signals.

biq EMITS standard signals (backend.signals); this lets it LISTEN. Reading
partner's signals is legitimate information (partner tells you publicly — not
peeking) and genuinely sharpens defence. The method is convention-INVERSION:
biq knows the convention it expects partner to use (the same standard attitude/
count it emits), so a candidate partner hand is CONSISTENT only if, played under
that convention, it would have produced the very card partner actually played.

  * read(board, seat, ...)         -> the readable signal records from partner's
                                      completed plays.
  * consistent(records, hand, ...) -> True if a hand reproduces every signal
                                      (the HARD FILTER for the sampler).
  * mis_signals(records, ...)      -> the signals partner's ACTUAL hand would
                                      NOT have produced (end-of-hand teaching
                                      feedback + the auto-disable counter).

Only CLEAR free signals are read: partner followed suit, did not win, played a
SPOT (not an honour), and had a choice — attitude when our side led the suit,
count when an opponent did. Forced cards carry no signal, so they constrain
nothing.
