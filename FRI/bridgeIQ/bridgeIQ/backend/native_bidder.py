"""
NativeBiddingEngine — a from-scratch rule-based bidder modelled on Qplus 17.

Plug-compatible with BridgeEngine.get_bid: takes (BoardState, Seat) and
returns an EngineResponse whose `action` is the chosen Bid.

Card play is NOT handled here. Per BridgeEngine, biq is NN-free: the
engine is rule-based for bidding, native_lead for opening leads, and
Monte-Carlo + DDS (get_mc_card_play) for follow-on cards. BEN has
been REMOVED; do not assume any neural-net dependency.

Systems wired (see backend/bidding_systems.py for the full catalog):
  * SAYC
  * TwoOverOne (2/1 GF)
  * StandardAcol
  * StandardFrench
  * Precision90M

Conventions implemented across the systems:
  Stayman + Smolen, Jacoby transfers (major + Texas), Blackwood /
  1430 RKC, splinters, negative doubles, Lebensohl (over 1NT-(2X)),
  Michaels cuebid, Unusual 2NT, jump preempts, weak twos, Italian
  cuebidding, Gerber (4C ace-ask after opening NT), Grand-slam
  force (5NT after major-trump-agreed), Bergen-style 4D trump-
  quality ask, count-to-grand path over 2NT openings.

Architecture:
  An AuctionContext (backend/auction_context.py) is computed once
  per decide_bid via a single pass over the bid stream. It exposes
  typed primitives — trump (with mechanism), gf_established,
  slam_zone_entered, controls_shown, last_4nt_is_{rkc,quantitative},
  forcing (ForcingContext), captain, convention (e.g. STAYMAN,
  JACOBY_TRANSFER, GERBER, FOURTH_SUIT_FORCING) — so downstream
  decision sites read from the context instead of re-deriving
  auction state. See plan_option1_semantic_state.md.

The dispatch is a flat decision tree keyed on auction state plus the
context primitives. There is no tree search; the goal is "a defensible
bid for every common situation, anchored in textbook convention."
Pathological auctions fall back to Pass via the sanity wrapper.

# Italian-style cuebidding (Phase 3 of the slam-architecture plan)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Once a trump suit is agreed at the 3M / 4M level, an "Italian" slam
# auction exchanges first-round controls (ace or void) up the line,
# then second-round controls (king or singleton), then RKC for keys.
# The benefit over jumping straight to 4NT is that each side sees
# WHICH side suits the other controls, so grand-slam decisions get
# the right answer instead of a coin flip.
#
# Scope of this MVP:
#   • Trump is a MAJOR (H or S). Minor-suit cuebidding is rarer in
#     2/1 / SAYC and lower leverage on the slam-corpus dig.
#   • Trump was set at 3M or 4M by a partner-or-mine raise.
#   • Auction is below 4NT.
#   • Hand has slam-going values (defer to existing 4NT-launch
#     callers — they only call us when they would have launched
#     RKC; our job is to cuebid first if there's something to show).
#   • Continuation: after a cuebid is on the table, both partners
#     keep cuebidding upward until one runs out of cheaper controls,
#     at which point that partner launches 4NT RKC.

    #     game-forcing. Raise the suit with support, NT with
    #     stoppers, rebid own suit with extras.
