"""Partner SIGNAL-TRUST — escalating feedback + auto-disable for signal reading.

biq reads partner's signals (signal_read) to sharpen its defence; that only helps
if partner signals reliably. A biq partner does. A HUMAN may not. After each hand
we check partner's ACTUAL play for MIS-SIGNALS (cards the standard convention
would NOT have produced from their real hand) and escalate:

  TRUSTING  read partner's signals (default).
  COMPLAIN  a slip: a gentle after-hand note.
  WARN      it keeps happening: an explicit warning.
  DISABLED  still happening: STOP reading partner's signals + raise a flag the
            UI shows, so the user knows biq no longer trusts their carding.

A clean signalling hand decays the pressure, so a one-off slip is forgiven, and a
reformed partner earns trust back. State is per-session; call reset() per match.
