"""No-peek DECLARER planner — global declarer-side play, never peeking.

When biq's side declares, it legitimately sees BOTH its own hand and dummy
(full information for the 26 declarer-side cards); only the defenders' 26 cards
are hidden. So the declarer can PLAN across both hands — manage entries, unblock,
cash in the right order, get to the hand that holds the winners — without ever
looking at a hidden card. Per-seat no-peek can't do this (each seat decides in
isolation), which is the bulk of its declarer gap vs Q-Plus.

This module plans the declarer-side LEAD. It is consulted by backend.nopeek for
declarer-side seats on lead, after trumps are drawn; it returns a card to play
or None to fall through to the per-seat technique.

Piece 1 (here): CROSS TO THE WINNING HAND. When the hand on lead has no
guaranteed winner of its own to cash but the PARTNER hand does, lead a low card
in a suit partner can win, so partner takes the lead and its winners can be run.
This is the cross-hand capability per-seat play lacks; it is used as a smarter
default than leading a passive low card into nothing. Cashing this hand's OWN
winners is left to the per-seat cash-boss logic (cashing order/establishment
interact subtly and a naive global cash hurt).
