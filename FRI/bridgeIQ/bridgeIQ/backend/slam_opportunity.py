"""Slam-opportunity detector.

Decides whether the side to bid plausibly has a slam available, so the
Q-Plus-style Simulation pop-up can be triggered automatically. The
detector is intentionally conservative: false positives interrupt the
user, false negatives just mean they have to open the dialog manually
from the menu.

Heuristic (any one is sufficient):

  * Combined estimated HCP ≥ 30 from own hand + partner's minimum
    from their opening / response.
  * Own hand has slam-strength shape (≥ 17 HCP with a 6-card suit,
    or ≥ 19 HCP balanced) and partner has shown an opening.
  * Auction itself already contains slam-try machinery — RKC ask,
    Gerber, jump-shift, quantitative 4NT — meaning *someone* on the
    side has decided slam is in scope.
