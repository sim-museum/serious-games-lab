"""Plain-English explanations for biq's actions — bids and card plays.

biq is rule-based: every call it makes follows from the chosen bidding
system, and every card it plays follows from its card-play technique. This
module turns that reasoning into prose for the optional "Explain action"
popup (Preferences → *Explain biq's actions*, default **OFF**).

It is a pure PRESENTATION layer. It never makes or changes a decision; it
only describes one already made, using:

* for bids — the engine's own reason captured on the `Bid.explanation`
  field at decision time, plus the system-grounded meaning from
  `bid_descriptions.describe_bid` (point range / shape / convention);
* for cards — the PUBLIC trick situation (cards on the table, the
  contract, who is winning) plus the technique label. It deliberately
  does NOT read biq's concealed holding, so the popup can never leak
  hidden cards (the no-peek instrumentation rule).
