"""Strategic cardplay planner — above DDS.

biq's MC+DDS engine plays each card *locally optimally against a
probabilistic guess of the layout*. That's an architectural ceiling:
no per-card decision can encode "I need to draw trumps and cash my
top tricks in the right order to make 4 spades". This module is the
beginning of a textbook-anchored plan-builder that operates above
DDS, similar to how `native_bidder.py` operates above the simple
"first legal bid" fallback.

Built incrementally, one rule per phase, with measured impact each
time. This file is Phase 1 only — the trump-drawing lead rule.

Phase 1 (this file): declarer's trump-drawing lead.
Phase 2 (later): follow-suit rules (second-hand-low, unblock
  prevention from dummy).
Phase 3 (later): suit-establishment plans, entry counting.
Phase 4 (later): defender signaling.
Phase 5 (later): endplay / squeeze recognition.

      current trick cards — caller's responsibility).

    Returns None if no rule fires cleanly (then MC+DDS picks).
    Avoids leading trumps and avoids singletons/short suits when no
    clear textbook lead applies — those need more context (ruff
    play, suit-preference signal expectations) than Phase 3 has.
