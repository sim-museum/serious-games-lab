"""Infer per-seat constraints from a bid sequence.

The MC card-play engine already uses simple first-bid constraints
(`_derive_hcp_constraints`, `_derive_shape_constraints` in engine.py)
to filter implausible sample hands. This module extends that idea
to the full auction:

  * Opener's rebid pins HCP tighter (12-14 / 16-18 / 19-21 etc.)
  * Responder's call pins responder's HCP and often shape.
  * Stayman / transfer / Jacoby 2NT / splinter sequences add
    confident length and HCP inferences.

For each seat we maintain (hcp_min, hcp_max) and per-suit
(min_len, max_len). When subsequent bids tighten a range,
we narrow it; if a later bid contradicts an earlier inference
(rare — should only happen if the bidder strayed from system),
we drop the constraint rather than reject the sample.

The module also returns human-readable explanation strings for
each constraint — used by the teaching UI to show
"East's 1NT shows 15-17 HCP balanced."
