"""Auction-semantic primitives — Option 1 of the slam-architecture roadmap.

Problem: biq's bidder re-derives "what's going on in this auction" at
every decision site by re-walking state.bids with ad-hoc heuristics
(_agreed_trump, _is_rkc_context, _trump_set_level, splinter detection,
GF detection scattered through each system path…). This causes:
  * The same primitive disagrees across sites (e.g. _agreed_trump's
    fallback returns the last suit bid; _trump_set_level rejects single
    mentions — Deal 39 phantom slam came from this disagreement).
  * Adding any new convention requires touching N call sites.
  * Each convention's edge cases hide in a different function.

Solution: walk state.bids ONCE per decide_bid call, materialise the
auction's high-level meaning as a typed AuctionContext, and let every
downstream site read from the context rather than re-derive.

Phase A (this file): trump_set + slam_zone_entered + gf_established +
controls_shown. Forcing-context derivation is sketched but not yet
populated. Convention-state and captain are placeholders for Phase B.

Migration policy: existing functions like _agreed_trump and
_is_rkc_context remain as wrappers calling the context. Sites can
migrate at their own pace; the context is computed once per decide_bid
and threaded through.
