"""Strategic cardplay planner — overrides DDS for discard decisions.

The MC+DDS engine evaluates each card on freshly-sampled hypothetical
hands. For a discard situation (out of the led suit), the DDS scores
for honors vs small cards differ only by per-sample noise — which
can systematically push the engine to discard winners (saw biq pitch
the ♥A, ♦K, ♦Q, ♦A in a single 3NT deal on which Q-Plus made 12 tricks).

This module adds two pre-DDS filters for the discard-only path:

1. Boss-card protection: a card is "boss" if no higher rank of its
   suit can be in opponents' hands. Boss cards are guaranteed future
   winners — never discard one.

2. Top-of-holding protection: protect the upper half of own-side's
   combined holding in each suit. These are either top-tricks
   already (honors) or top-of-length cards that anchor a length
   establishment. Discarding them throws away trick sources. The
   bottom half (small cards) is safe to discard — the suit-establishment
   plan only needs the long count, not the specific small ranks.

Only declarer/dummy seats get protection in this MVP, since the
planner needs to see both hands of the side it plans for. Defender
planning needs partner-hand inference (later).
