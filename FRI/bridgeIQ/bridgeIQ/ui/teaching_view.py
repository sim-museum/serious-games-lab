"""Instrumented (teaching / analysis) cardplay view.

An alternative to the normal table — a four-hand "cross" where each
hand is a 4-row (♠♥♦♣) × 2-column (Known | Other) grid, surrounded by
analysis panels. It is meant to be useful to BOTH a trainee (count your
tricks, where are the entries, what is partner signalling) AND a strong
player (full count, proven card placement, honour location, squeeze /
BLUE readiness) — the Detail selector (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert)
scales how much is shown.

Layout (3×3 grid; corners are analysis panels, the cross sits on the
edges + centre):

    Contract/Tricks |      NORTH       | Plan (winners/losers/trumps)
    ----------------+------------------+-----------------------------
        WEST        |  trick + detail  |            EAST
    ----------------+------------------+-----------------------------
    Count / honours |      SOUTH       | Coaching / signals

What is shown per suit row:
  • KNOWN  — cards we can PROVE are in that hand right now: exact cards
    for a face-up hand (own + dummy + Show-All), and for a hidden hand
    only cards forced there (sole seat not shown out of the suit).
  • OTHER  — derived info: inferred length range (auction ∩ play), void,
    and honour-location hints.

Highlights on Known cards: the current master (boss) of a suit, top-run
sure winners, and the trump suit. Everything degrades gracefully when
state is missing, so the view is safe to refresh at any point in a hand.
