"""Context-aware coaching notes — short, specific, no citations.

`coaching_note(...)` returns ONE short paragraph tuned to the live situation:
the active bidding system's real parameters, the vulnerability, and the
specific cards of THIS deal (visible and inferable). The wording is authored
from the book corpus (see tools/ingest_book_library.py) and stored as
templates in backend/data/coach/note_catalog.json; the rendered text is built
entirely from live board state, so it can never leak a hidden card or mis-cite.

NO PEEKING, EVER:
  * bidding notes read only the asking seat's own hand (legitimate — the hint
    is gated to the user's own turn);
  * play notes flow through `known_layout(board, visible)` and the `visible`
    set, exactly like the instrumentation view — never `board.hands[hidden]`.
