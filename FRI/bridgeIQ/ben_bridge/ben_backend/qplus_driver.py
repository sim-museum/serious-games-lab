"""Q-Plus diff oracle: feed deals in via OWN-DEALS .BDE, capture BDL output.

Q-Plus has no Bridge Table Manager protocol — its networking is
Q-NET.EXE, a proprietary peer-to-peer over TCP/DDE that's
expensive to reverse-engineer. The practical alternative is file
injection:

  1. Write a multi-deal `.BDE` file into Q-Plus's
     `DATA/OWN-DEALS/` directory.
  2. User loads it (Own deals → Open → BB_DIFF.BDE) and steps
     through each deal letting Q-Plus auto-play.
  3. Q-Plus writes one `log-NNN.bdl` per played deal into
     `DATA/LOG/`.
  4. We snapshot LOG/ before, poll for new BDLs after each
     deal completes, and parse them through `bdl_reader` to
     extract the auction for diffing.

This module provides the file I/O and polling helpers; the
orchestrator lives in `tools/qplus_diff.py`.

    `snapshot_log_files`. The richer dict form enables
    overwrite detection.
