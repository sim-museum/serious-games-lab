"""Rule-based opening lead engine — Q-Plus-style, no neural network.

The opening lead has two pieces:

  1. **Suit selection**: pick the most promising suit to attack.
     Influenced heavily by the auction (partner's bid suits, opp's
     bid suits, NT vs trump contract, declarer strength).
  2. **Card selection**: given the chosen suit, pick the spot card
     by lead convention (4th best, top of sequence, top of
     doubleton, MUD, A from AKxx, etc.).

This module replaces the NN-based `botopeninglead.BotLead`. It
uses no `tensorflow` / `keras` / `nn.*` imports.

Public entry point:

    select_opening_lead(hand, contract, auction, vulnerability) -> Card

`hand` is the leader's hand (LHO of declarer).
`contract` carries level / suit / declarer.
`auction` is the full sequence of Bids (used to find partner's
bid suits and opp's bid suits).
`vulnerability` is used for marginal decisions (we lean a bit
more conservative when vulnerable — fewer aggressive low-card
leads into the opps' suits).
